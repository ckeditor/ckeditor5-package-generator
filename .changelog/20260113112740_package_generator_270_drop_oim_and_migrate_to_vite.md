Remove Support for Old Installation Methods.

As previously announced, the end of March 2026 marks the end of support for Old Installation Methods (OIM), except for Long-Term Support (LTS) releases. This change is part of our ongoing efforts to modernize our tooling and improve the developer experience.

As a result, the package generator no longer supports OIM-based projects. We encourage all projects to migrate to the new, modern installation methods.
