Removed `--installation-methods` (`-m`) flag that was used to provide the CKEditor 5 installation method: either the current (modern) method or the legacy (DLL-based) one. Now, only the current installation method is supported, so no DLL-based files and configurations are generated anymore. For more details on migrating custom plugins, please refer to the [documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/nim-migration/custom-plugins.html).
