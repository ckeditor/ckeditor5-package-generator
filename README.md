## Developing the `ckeditor5-package-generator` repository

* Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:ckeditor/ckeditor5-package-generator.git`
* Install required dependencies: `yarn install`

### Creating a package

To create a new package, call the `ckeditor5-package-generator` executable file. It requires a single argument which is the package name. It must follow the schema: `@scope/ckeditor5-package`, where [@scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes) is an owner of the package, and `ckeditor5-package` is the package name. It must start with the `ckeditor5-` prefix.

The tool will create a new directory called `ckeditor5-package` with an example plugin called `MyPlugin` and tools for developing the package.

To use a local version of the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-package-tools` package, use the `--dev` option when executing the command.

```bash
node /path/to/repository/packages/ckeditor5-package-generator <packageName> [--dev] [--verbose] [--use-npm] [--use-yarn]
```

#### Options

* `--verbose` - (alias: `-v`) whether to prints additional logs about the current executed task.
* `--dev` - whether to execute in the development mode. It means that the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-package-tools` will not be installed from npm, but from the local file system.
* `--use-npm` - whether to use `npm` to install dependencies in a newly created package.
* `--use-yarn` - whether to use `yarn` to install dependencies in a newly created package. This option is ignored if `yarn` is not installed.

#### Developing the package

Available scripts and their modifiers are described in the [`README.md` file of the `ckeditor5-package-generator` package](/packages/ckeditor5-package-generator).

#### Package metadata

The `ckeditor5-metadata.json` file contains data of the package that allows for an automated detection of plugins and processing them by external scripts. Information about how this file should be maintained is available in the [official guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/contributing/package-metadata.html). Keep in mind that this file has no effect on how the plugin work.

### Developing tools in the repository

When creating a new package with the `--dev` option, the local version of the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-package-tools` will be installed instead of its npm version.

However, applying changes in the local repository does not impact an already created package. Hence, you need to create a [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link/) between the local repository and the new package.

```bash
# The assumption here is your current working directory points to the root directory in the repository.
cd packages/ckeditor5-package-tools
yarn link

# Then, go to the newly created package.
cd /path/to/new/package/ckeditor5-foo
yarn link @ckeditor/ckeditor5-package-tools
```

Now, the newly created package uses changes from the local repository.

## Releasing packages

### Changelog

1. Fetch all changes and switch to the `##master` branch.
2. Execute `npm run changelog`:

  * Scan the logs printed by the tool â€“ search for errors (incorrect changelog entries). Incorrect entries (e.g., ones without the type) are being ignored. You may need to create entries for them manually. This is done directly in `CHANGELOG.md` (in the root directory). Make sure to verify the proposed version after you modify the changelog.
  * When unsure what has changed in this version of a specific package, use `git diff <hash of the previous release> packages/<name>/`.

### Publishing

After generating the changelog, you are ready for publishing packages.

First, you need to bump their versions:

```bash
npm run release:bump-version
```

You can also use the `--dry-run` option to see what this task does.

After bumping versions, you can publish changes:

```bash
npm run release:publish
```

As in the previous task, the `--dry-run` option is also available.
